Overview
========

Logcheck is a simple utility which is designed to allow a system administrator to view the logfiles which are produced upon hosts under their control.

It does this by mailing summaries of the logfiles to them, after first filtering out "normal" entries.

Normal entries are entries which match one of the many included regular expression files contain in the database.

This Project
============

This project is intended to be the place for all future development of logcheck which seems to be dead upstream.

Any Debian developer, or other volunteer is welcome to join in discussion on the mailing lists, or comment.

There are several aims of this project:

    Recode logcheck to be more understandable, with increased documentation.
    Have a more complete, and maintainable, collection of rule files.
    Encourage other users to collaborate.
